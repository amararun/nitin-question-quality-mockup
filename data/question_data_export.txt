The leaves are only partly dried. They are then put into rolling machines, which break up the leaf cells. This releases the natural juices which give tea its special taste. It also gives a twist to the leaf.<br />After rolling, the leaves are spread out in a damp atmosphere and left to ferment to a bright coppery colour.
