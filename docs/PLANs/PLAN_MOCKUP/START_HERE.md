# 🚀 React Mockup - Ready to Start!

## ✅ Everything is READY for AI Coder

Your AI coder can **start building immediately** with zero blockers.

---

## 📦 What's Included

### 1. **MOCKUP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (Main guide)
- Complete project context and business requirements
- Architecture overview and tech stack
- File structure and component breakdown
- 5 implementation phases (each independently testable)
- Design system specifications (colors, typography, spacing)
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Step-by-step tasks with time estimates
- Testing checklist for each phase
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### 2. **Dummy Sample Data** (Ready to use)
✅ `dummy_questions_sample.json` - 40 questions with variety
✅ `dummy_dashboard_metrics.json` - Realistic metrics
✅ `dummy_api_logs.json` - 8 API call logs
✅ `dummy_validation_report.json` - Complete validation report

**Data has realistic variety:**
- Processed vs unprocessed questions
- Approved vs pending vs rejected
- Questions with corrections vs no changes
- Different topics and worksheet IDs
- Different error classifications

### 3. **Template Files** (For your reference when you create real data)
- `TEMPLATE_questions_sample.json` - Shows structure
- `TEMPLATE_dashboard_metrics.json` - Shows structure
- `TEMPLATE_api_logs.json` - Shows structure
- `TEMPLATE_validation_report.json` - Shows structure

## 🎯 For AI Coder: How to Start

### Option 1: Start Building NOW (Recommended)
```bash
1. Read MOCKUP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (10 min)
2. Initialize project (Phase 1, Step 1-2)
3. Use dummy_*.json files as sample data
4. Build all 5 phases sequentially
5. Complete mockup in ~2-3 days
```

**No waiting required.** Dummy data is realistic and complete.

### Option 2: Wait for Real Data
- User will export real data from Excel later
- Replace dummy files with real files (simple find-replace)
- ~5 minute task to swap data

**We recommend Option 1** - start now, replace data later.

- Table view with pagination
- Expand button → Full question modal
- See original + AI rewrites + final versions
- Filter by status, classification
- Refresh button

### Module 2: LLM Connection
- Parameters tab (model, tokens, temperature)
- Submit → Loading 5-7 seconds
- API Details tab (summary)
- Dashboard tab (metrics + charts + tables)
- API Logs tab (expandable JSON)

### Module 3: Batch Update
- Shows count of approved questions
- Submit → Progress bar (15-20 seconds)
- Validation report (6 detailed sections)
- Download PDF button (mocked)
- Copy CSV button
- Rollback button

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Building the mockup:**
- Time: ~2-3 days for experienced React dev
- Phases: 5 phases, each 2-4 hours
- Total: ~15-20 hours of development

**Using the mockup:**
- Show to stakeholders for approval
- Guide real backend development
- Test UX flows before building database
- Get feedback on design

---

## 🔄 Later: Replace with Real Data

When you're ready, just:

1. **Export from Excel** - Run your tool on real questions
2. **Create real files:**
   - `questions_sample.json` (use template as guide)
   - `dashboard_metrics.json` (copy from Excel dashboard)
   - `api_logs.json` (copy from Python logs)
   - `validation_report.json` (mostly dummy, use template)
3. **Replace dummy files** - AI coder updates imports in `src/data/`
4. **Test** - Everything still works, now with real data

**No code changes needed** - just swap JSON files.

## 📞 Questions?

**For AI Coder:**
- All technical decisions documented in plan
- Judgment calls already made
- Design system specified
- Just follow phases 1-5 sequentially

**For You (Amar):**
- Review plan, give feedback if needed
- Export real data whenever convenient
- Can swap data anytime (even after mockup is built)

## 🎁 Bonus: What You Can Show Nitin

Once mockup is built, you can show:
1. **Full UI flow** - Browse → Process → Review → Update
2. **Professional design** - shadcn/ui, blue theme, compact
3. **All features working** - Filters, modals, progress bars, validation
4. **Realistic data** - Looks like real production
5. **Zero backend** - Pure frontend demo, no DB/API needed

Perfect for getting approval before building real system!
